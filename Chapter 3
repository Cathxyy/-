Adding the '' empty string to a string is a weird idea. But really, it doesn't do anything at all. 
It's like adding 0 to a number: it doesn't change anything.

the empty string is '' NOT ' '. There's no space between those quotes!
Then, trying to get s[0] would cause an error!

#EASY TO FOTGET
But if s is the '' empty string, then s[0] will cause an error because there is no character at position 0.

This is called an edge case in programming. It's a situation that doesn't come up too often (you usually don't need to use an empty string), but it does happen sometime.

It's easy to forget about edge cases and doing so is a common cause of bugs.
